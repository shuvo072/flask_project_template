# Developer Workflow: Creating a Feature Branch, Writing Code, and Creating a Pull Request

This guide outlines the steps for a developer to contribute code to the project by creating a new branch, writing their code, and creating a pull request for review and integration into the `develop` branch.

## Creating a New Feature

1. Start by creating a new branch from the `develop` branch. This branch will serve as the container for your new feature.
2. Give your feature branch a descriptive name that reflects the nature of the work you're going to do.

## Writing Your Code

3. On your new feature branch, start writing your code. Make sure to add, edit, or delete code as needed to implement your feature.
4. Commit your changes regularly with clear and descriptive commit messages.

## Creating a Pull Request

5. Push your feature branch to the remote repository, such as GitHub or GitLab.
6. Navigate to the repository's web interface and locate your newly pushed branch.
7. Create a pull request (PR) for your feature branch. In the PR:
   - Provide a concise and informative title.
   - Include a detailed explanation of the changes and why they are necessary.

## Review and Feedback

8. Wait for your team members or reviewers to review your PR. Be responsive to feedback and make necessary adjustments to your code.
9. Address any issues or comments raised during the review process.

## Merging the PR

10. Once your PR is approved and any required changes are made, it will be merged into the `develop` branch.

## Cleaning Up (Optional)

11. After the merge, you may choose to delete your feature branch to keep the repository tidy. This can be done locally and remotely if desired.

By following these steps, you can efficiently contribute to the development process by creating, coding, and submitting your changes for review and integration into the main development branch.
